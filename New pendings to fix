things to fix

so far so good, i have been able to create the iso and launch it and installed.


new pending things:
create a script that semiautomates the initial setup from live iso.


I found that after arch system is installed, the post-install.sh script will not be triggered. posibbly solution:

3. ‚ùå The ISO build only had the file in the Live ISO, not copied to the final installed system
If your ISO only included it in airootfs and didn‚Äôt have a script that copied it into the mounted /mnt during installation, then it won‚Äôt be present after install.

üîß Fix:
Inside your ISO‚Äôs live system, before running arch-chroot, do:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp /usr/local/bin/post-install.sh /mnt/usr/local/bin/
cp /etc/systemd/system/post-install.service /mnt/etc/systemd/system/
ln -s /etc/systemd/system/post-install.service /mnt/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/post-install.service
chmod +x /mnt/usr/local/bin/post-install.sh

if this fix is working, then, add it to the initial script that semiautomates the initial setup while in live iso
